does NimVersion = NimMajor.NimMinor.NimPatch? 1.6.10 = 1.6.10
on failure I call quit with 1

remainder of 5 / 2: 1
(x).clamp(y, z) is faster than max(y, min(z, x)) 2
can use blah% w/ generally any operator. ints are suppose to cast to uint before operation but doesnt seem to work
10 %% 3 = 1
3 *% -3 = -9
3 +% -3 = 0
3 <=% -3 = true
can use blah= w/ generally any operator to mutate in place 
*= will multiply in place and return void for ints/floats, lol remember those errors we kept getting in the beginning?
