##
## concurrency and parallelism (V2)
## ================================


##[
## TLDR
- continues where asyncPar.nim finishes and focuses on nim v2
- changes in v2
  - system.thread types moved to std/private/threadtypes
  - system.thread logic upgraded and moved to std/typedthreads
  - system.threads still works in v2, but you should prefer std/typedthreads
